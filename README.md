# Server Harden for Ansible

[![Version][version-image]][github-release]
[![License][license-image]][github-license]

This [Ansible][ansible] module provides a role to harden servers in a standard used by Andrew Vaughan.  While built
to a convention for this purpose, most options are extensible and configurable if you wish to use this server
configuration role in your project.

## Installation

This plugin is made available in [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy].  Once Ansible Galaxy is installed, you may install
this plugin with the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install andrewvaughan.server-harden
```

To use this plugin, simply add the role to your playbook file with the following addition:

```yml
roles:
  - andrewvaughan.server-harden
```

While this alone will add a conservative and conventional set of tasks to your playbook, a number of variables may be
set to modify, or disable, the [configuration](#configuration) of the tasks executed.

### Dependencies

This module uses functionality that requires a minimum version of [Ansible][ansible] v2.0.  It also relies on
dependencies from [Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy].  Both must be available on the executing platform.

Once Ansible and its dependencies have been installed, this plugin should be usable using the installation
instructions above.

Installing this role with Ansible Galaxy will manage dependencies for you.  However, if you are interested in
installing dependencies from source, a `Makefile` is provided for your convenience:

```bash
make dependencies
```

## Configuration

In order to configure the role, a `server_harden` variable can be set to configure various tasks within the role.  For
example:

```yaml
roles:
  - andrewvaughan.server-harden

vars:
  server_harden:
    config_option: # ... <-- see below
```

Default parameters, as defined in the [defaults file][var-defaults], can be overridden with this `server_harden`
variable.  You *do not* have to (and are often recommended *not* to) set your [hash_behaviour][ansible-hash] to
`merge` in your `ansible.cfg` for this to function correctly.  This role makes use of Ansible's
[combine filters][ansible-combine] to manage overrides gracefully, so you can override as many or as few of the
role defaults as you wish.

### Warning Prompt

By default, a warning prompt is presented to start ensuring the user wants to continue.  The functionality of this
can be managed with the `warning` object in the `server_harden` variable:

```yaml
vars:
  server_harden:

    warning:
      prompt  : true
      message : >
        Write your custom message here.
```

To disable the warning entirely, simply set `warning: false`.

#### `prompt`

The `prompt` option can be set to any of the following:

| Option              | Action                                                     |
|:-------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `true` <sup>†</sup> | Requires the user to respond `Y` to the prompt when warned |
| `false`             | Skips the prompt entirely                                  |
<em><small><sup>†</sup> default option</small></em>

#### `message`

The `message` option can be set to any custom string that will replace the warning message for the user.  To disable
the message, set the `warning` object to `false`.

### Root User Configuration

By default, a random, 11-to-15-character password is generated for the root user and displayed to the user.  This is
not generally the most recommended mechanism to set the root password.  It is more-preferred to have the root
password generated by the user, either in a vault file or some other mechanism, and provided to the role for
configuration.  The functionality of this can be managed with the `root` object in the `server_harden` variable:

```yaml
vars:
  server_harden:

    root:
      password : true
      ssh_keys : "{{ my_ssh_key }}"
```

To disable root user configuration entirely, simply set `root: false`.

#### `password`

The `password` option can be set to any of the following options:

| Option                         | Action                                                                                              |
|:------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <em>undefined</em><sup>†</sup> | Generates a random 11-to-15 character password for the root user, displaying it during the playbook |
| String                         | Provides the role the password to set for the root user *(recommended, from vault file)*            |
| `null`                         | Clears the root user's password *(NOT recommended)*                                                 |
| `true`                         | Prompts the user for the root password during the playbook                                          |
| `false`                        | Leaves the root user's password as-is                                                               |
<em><small><sup>†</sup> default option</small></em>

#### `ssh_keys`

The `ssh_keys` option can be set to any of the following options:

| Option              | Action                                              |
|:-------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------|
| String              | Sets the SSH authorized keys to the provided String |
| List                | Sets the SSH authorized keys to the provided List   |
| `null`              | Clears the SSH keys for the root user               |
| `false`<sup>†</sup> | Leaves the root user's SSH keys as-is               |
<em><small><sup>†</sup> default option</small></em>
